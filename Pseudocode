html

Create one row representing yellow box in example: our trivia panel
Within this, create a header row, a time remaining row, a question row, and a responses row

So something like:

div row "yellow-container"
	div row "header"
	div row "time remaining"
	div row "question"
	div row "responses"
<end div>

Must remember to store initial state for easy reset button functionality

gameState = {
	correctAnswers = 0,
	wrongAnswers = 0,
	timeRemaining: setTimeout(function() {}, 1000 * seconds);
	content = [
	{
		question: "Which Cub wears number 17?",
		answers: ["Kris Bryant", "Anthony Rizzo", "Javier Baez", Jon Lester],
		correctAnswer: "Kris Bryant"
	},
		{
		question: "Which Cleveland Indian committed a heinous error in Game 6 of the World Series?",
		answers: ["Mike Napoli", "Tyler Naquin", "Trevor Bauer", "Francisco Lindor"],
		correctAnswer: "Tyler Naquin"
	},

	]

	potentialQuestions: ["What is 1+1?", "What was Kris Bryant's WAR?", "What gaffe was made at the Oscars?", "Who won the Super Bowl?"],
	potentialAnswers: ["1"]
}

var questionBank

What if we created objects with the four answer set? And then linked them to the appropriate question using if then logic.
